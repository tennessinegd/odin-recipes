        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These chicken breasts are fast, easy, and delicious. By 'pan-roasting,' you can easily monitor the internal temp. Leaving the skin on adds a lot of flavor and much needed moisture.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless chicken breast halves with skin</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs (thyme, parsley, rosemary) (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons cold butter, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth (or water), if needed to thin sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it starts to shimmer. Place chicken breasts in skillet skin side down. Sprinkle with fresh herbs. Do not disturb the breasts until the skin side sears, 5 or 6 minutes. Turn chicken.</li>
            <li>Cook until internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F, about 5 minutes. Add vinegar and butter to pan with chicken. Shake pan gently until butter melts and internal temperature of chicken reaches 160 to 165 degrees F, 2 to 3 minutes more. Add a splash of chicken broth or water if sauce needs to be thinned.</li>
        </ol>
